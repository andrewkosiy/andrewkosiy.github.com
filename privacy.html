                <p>BY ACCESSING AND/OR USING THE SITE FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATSOEVER, YOU AGREE TO THE COLLECTION AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION, ALL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET HEREUNDER.</p>

                <h5>THE DATA SUBJECT'S RIGHTS</h5>
                <p>Data protection laws grant you, as a data subject, certain ‘information rights’, which are summarized below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Right of access - You have the right to obtain a copy of information we hold about you.</li>
                    <li>Right of rectification or erasure - If you feel that any data that we hold about you is inaccurate, you have the right to ask us to correct or rectify it. You also have a right to ask us to erase information about you where you can demonstrate that the data we hold is no longer needed by us, or if you withdraw the consent upon which our processing is based, or if you feel that we are unlawfully processing your data. Please note that we may be entitled to retain your personal data despite your request, for example if we are under a separate legal obligation to retain it. Your right of rectification and erasure extends to anyone we have disclosed your personal information to and we will take all reasonable steps to inform those with whom we have shared their data about your request for erasure.</li>
                    <li>Right to restriction of processing - You have a right to request that we refrain from processing your data where you contest its accuracy, or the processing is unlawful and you have opposed its erasure, or where we do not need to hold your data any longer but you need us to in order to establish, exercise or defend any legal claims, or we are in dispute about the legality of our processing your personal data.</li>
                    <li>Right to Portability - You have a right to receive any personal data that you have provided to us in order to transfer it onto another data controller where the processing is based on consent and is carried out by automated means. This is called a data portability request.</li>
                    <li>Right to Object - You have a right to object to our processing your personal data where the basis of the processing is our legitimate interests including but not limited to direct marketing and profiling.</li>
                    <li>Right to Withdraw Consent - You have the right to withdraw your consent for the processing of your personal data where the processing is based on consent.</li>
                    <li>Right of Complaint - You also have the right to lodge a complaint about any aspect of how we are handling your data with the applicable regulatory authority.</li>
                    <li>Right to Opt-out of Marketing Communications - You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send to you at any time. You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing emails we send you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h5>HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                <p>We will hold information about you in our data systems only for as long as we need it for the purpose for which we collected it.</p>
                <p>As long as you continue to log into the Site or use our services, we will retain and process information about you. In such cases, you will be considered to be an ‘active’ user.

Should such an event occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy notice with respect to your personal information. If we intend to handle your personal information for any purposes not covered in this privacy notice, you will receive prior notification of the processing of your personal information for the new purposes.</p>

                <h5>SECURITY</h5>
